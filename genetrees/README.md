* The main analyses reported in the paper (Figure 2) are based on gene trees given in the [Best.33.FAA.tre](Best.33.FAA.tre) file.

* We also provide gene trees used in other analyses. File names use these conventions
    - Best.FAA.tre: fully resolved best ML gene trees computed by RAxML on FAA alignments
    - Best.[N].FAA.tre: best ML gene trees on FAA alignments contracted  to remove branches with below N% support
    - Best.FNA2AA-C12.tre: fully resolved best ML gene trees computed by RAxML on FNA-2AA-C12 (i.e., AA translated back to DNA with 3rd position removed) alignments

* The following are filtered gene trees (and also supergene trees obtained from statistical binning), used in ASTRAL trees shown in Supplementary Figure S10.

* The order of gene trees in the files is the order of `ls` on the genes directory. To be clear, the order is given [here](order.txt).
