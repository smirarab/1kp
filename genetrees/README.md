* The main analyses reported in the paper (Figure 2) are based on gene trees given in the [Best.33.FAA.tre](Best.33.FAA.tre) file.

* We also provide gene trees used in other analyses. File names use these conventions
    - Best.FAA.tre: fully resolved best ML gene trees computed by RAxML on FAA alignments
    - Best.[N].FAA.tre: best ML gene trees on FAA alignments contracted  to remove branches with below N% support
    - Best.FNA2AA-C12.tre: fully resolved best ML gene trees computed by RAxML on FNA-2AA-C12 alignments

* The following are filtered gene trees and also supergene trees obtained from statistical binning, used in ASTRAL trees shown in Supplementary Figure S10.
